# FrozedDisguise

## Information about open-sourcing this
FrozedDisguise got supposedly "cracked" by some retard called "Got" (Discord ID: 537638302640242709 | Discord: Got#9416) because he thinks he's funny and a 1337 Hackerman for "cracking" this plugin, which is shit.

First of all, there was literally nothing to crack in this, you could literally execute on your server, and it would work perfectly fine. I wouldn't recommend using the version he released on his leaking discord, instead compile and use this one. I'm not responsible for anything that happens if you use the leaked version.

The code on this thing is almost 3 years old and outdated asf; anyways, I decided to open source this because the code is absolutely garbage and not worth anything.

Usage terms:
  * You cannot claim that this was all made from scratch by you.
  * All original comments and credits have to be KEPT in the code.
  * You can only use this private and personal use, not commercial use.
  * If you use this, you have to credit both Elb1to & Brou, as well as linking this repository.
