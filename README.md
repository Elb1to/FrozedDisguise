# FrozedDisguise
 Disguise plugin managed by FrozedDevelopement

Some of you may have know that FrozedDisguise got supposedly "cracked" by some retard called "Got" (Discord ID: 537638302640242709 | Discord #: Got#9416) because he thinks he's funny and a 1337 Hackerman for "cracking" this plugin, which is shit.

First of all, there was literally nothing to crack in this, you could literally execute on your server, and it would work perfectly fine

I wouldn't use the version he released on his leaking discord because he probably added some weird stuff in it, I'm not sure about it.

Anyways, I decided to open source this because the code is absolutely garbage and not worth anything anyways, here you go!
