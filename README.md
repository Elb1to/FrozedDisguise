# FrozedDisguise
All-in-one disguise plugin, perfect for PvP Servers

## Information
FrozedDisguise got supposedly "cracked" by some retard called "Got" (Discord ID: 537638302640242709 | Discord: Got#9416) because he thinks he's funny and a 1337 Hackerman for "cracking" this plugin, which is shit.

First of all, there was literally nothing to crack in this, you could literally execute on your server, and it would work perfectly fine. I wouldn't recommend using the version he released on his leaking discord, instead compile and use this one. I'm not responsible for anything that happens if you use the leaked version.

## Disclaimer
This used to be a paid resource, but I decided to open-source it to prevent people from using the leaked version and any potential damage to their systems.

## Reminder
The code on this thing is almost 3 years old, outdated as fuck and somewhat shit.
